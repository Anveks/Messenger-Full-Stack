1. on each sent message an unread message gets created ++
2. in users menu per each user there should be an icon indicating how many unread messages from each user do i have; store it in redux + subscribe to it to track the data 
3. when you click on a conversation with a user, all the unreadMessages that have matching senderId should be deleted from the database, number should disappear; isRead property in a MessageModel should change to 'true'
4. if it is an on-going chat, no need to create any unreadMessages - probably here the client should send an optional argument to the send() function on the backend ?

extra: below each user in usersMenu display the last unread message

TODO 25.06:
1. add a condition that would block the unread messages redux update if you are getting messages in the current conversation;
2. clear message and unread message data on logout;


check why setOnline to false doesnt work on logout
